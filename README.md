# CodexGlyph Engine
A Python-based natural language processing (NLP) engine for analyzing text through semantic, morphological, and structural glyph patterns.

CodexGlyph is an experimental linguistic tool designed to explore deeper relationships within language.  
It blends modern NLP techniques with custom pattern-detection algorithms to identify glyph structures, semantic weight, conceptual categories, and morphological signatures inside raw text.

## 🔍 Features

### **Core Capabilities**
- **Semantic Pattern Detection**  
  Identifies conceptual relationships, thematic clusters, and glyph-like units of meaning.

- **Morphological Analysis**  
  Breaks down words into root components, affixes, clusters, and lexical families.

- **Glyph Mapping System**  
  Assigns symbolic structures to text segments based on pattern recurrence and linguistic geometry.

- **Structural Text Parsing**  
  Analyzes sentence structure, phrase weight, and lexical frequency.

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  Built to be modular — new glyph rules, analyzers, or classification layers can be added easily.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists
CodexGlyph attempts to bridge traditional linguistics with more abstract forms of meaning detection.  
It aims to answer questions like:

- **What hidden patterns exist in language beyond syntax and semantics?**  
- **Can meaning be represented as “glyphs” — recurring conceptual shapes?**  
- **Can text be analyzed structurally and symbolically at the same time?**

The engine explores these questions by combining:

- NLP  
- pattern recognition  
- linguistic geometry  
- symbolic classification  
- algorithmic structure analysis
